This dashboard was built using many great tools in the R ecosystem. Thanks to all of the developers of these open source packages:

- [shiny]
- [rtweet]
- [shinydashboard]
- [plotly]
- [tidyverse]
- [shinycssloaders]
- [DT]

...and many more. For a full list of project dependencies, see [deps.yaml](deps.yaml).

I also built a few things to make this work, including:

- [gathertweet] - A command line tool for gathering tweets from Twitter search streams. Removes the boilerplate of collecting Twitter data and plays nicely with `cron`.

- [shinyThings] - [shiny] modules for pagination and dropdown buttons.

- [shinydashboard][shinydashboard-fork] (fork) - I forked [shinydashboard] to add a few features I needed to make this work the way I wanted.

- [adminlte-ocean-next] - An [AdminLTE] dashboard color theme.
