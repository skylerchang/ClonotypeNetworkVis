# Immune Repertoire Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the Immune Repertoire Analysis Dashboard, a powerful and user-friendly R Shiny application designed to facilitate comprehensive analysis of antigen receptor CDR3 amino acid sequences. This dashboard enables users to explore their data through four main aspects: Data Input and Processing, Statistical Analysis, Network Analysis, and Phylogenetic Analysis. Below, you'll find an overview of each aspect, along with links to tutorial videos that demonstrate their functionalities.

## Data Input and Processing

The Data Input and Processing module allows users to upload their own files or integrate data from our database or their personal database. It includes:

- **File Upload**: Easily upload your immune repertoire data files.
- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly integrate your data with our extensive database or your own.
- **Anchor Clustering**: Run Anchor Clustering to group amino acid sequences (1 Hamming distance) and generate cluster parameters for network features.

## Statistical Analysis

The Statistical Analysis module provides various visualizations and analyses to understand the distribution and overlap of clonotypes:

- **Clonotype Distribution**: View clonotype distributions across different junction lengths, cell types, samples, and V and J genes.
- **Clonotype Overlap**: Check for clonotype overlaps across different samples, cell types, or gene segments.

## Network Analysis

The Network Analysis module is the most engaging part of the dashboard. It allows users to:

- **Cluster Visualization**: Visualize all clusters with key network features.
- **Node Visualization**: Display nodes with different samples, cells, or V and J gene types.
- **Grouped Clusters**: Customize the visualization by specifying the level of spread and cluster size.
- **Interactive Clusters**: Click on any dot to explore the network connections of each cluster.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Show node-specific clonotypes within clusters.


## Phylogenetic Analysis

The Phylogenetic Analysis module provides insights into the evolutionary relationships of clonotypes:

- **Phylogenetic Relationships**: Explore the phylogenetic relationships of clonotypes within each cluster.
- **Multiple Sequence Alignment**: View multiple sequence alignment results to understand sequence similarities and differences.

## Tutorial Videos

For each module, we have prepared tutorial videos to guide you through their functionalities:
